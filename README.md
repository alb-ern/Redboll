# **REDBOL** <sub>with ai
#### **My first python project dont be harsh**
#### So thers ball learns deterministic environment by totally random genetic algorithm
---
>V1 is game for person to play.<br>
>V1ai is training ai and printing fitness into terminal<br>
>V1replay lets you watch latest best creature<br>
>project was based on numpy only best creatures brain is saved with numpy auto pickle<br>
>making continu=True on V1ai will make next trainings all batch be latest best creature<br>
>dont change batch size right now<br>
>h key will toggle hitbox. everything is rectangle actually<br>
> ~~supervised or reinforcement what you call~~ i deducted fitness by behaviors i dont like<br>
>jumpCount is deductive element dont ask why<br>
>no oop<br>
>algorithm.algorithm is brain that ai and replay uses. master has generally one per batch functions<br>
run replay yourself thers already a creature in data.npy
